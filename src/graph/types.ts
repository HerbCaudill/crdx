 * A hash graph is an acyclic directed graph of links. Each link is **asymmetrically encrypted and

 *
 * This means that the graph is **append-only**: Existing nodes can’t be modified, reordered, or
 * removed without causing the hash and authentication checks to fail.
 *
 * A hash graph is just data and can be stored as JSON. It consists of a hash table of the links
 * themselves, plus the hash of the **root** (the “founding” link added when the graph was created)
 * and the **head** (the most recent link(s) we know about). It also contains information about the
 * dependency structure of the graph, which is used to determine the order in which links should be
 * decrypted.
 *
 * The `EncryptedGraph` can live in public. Each link is asymmetrically encrypted using the author's
 * secret key and the team public key at time of authoring.
