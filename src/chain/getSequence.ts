/**
 * Takes a `SignatureChain` and returns an array of links by recursively performing a topographical
 * sort and filter. For example, this chain
 * ```
 *              ┌─→ c ─→ d ─┐
 *    a ─→ b ─→ ┴─→ e ───── * ─→ f
 * ```
 *  might be transformed to this sequence
 * ```
 *    [a, b, e, c, d, f]
 * ```
 *
 * The logic for merging these branches is encapsulated in a `Resolver` function provided in the
 * options. In the example above, the two concurrent branches `[c, d]` and `[e]` are resolved as
 * `[e, c, d]`. A different resolver might return the links in a different order, and/or omit some
 * links; so these concurrent branches might also be resolved as:
 * ```
 *   [c, d, e]
 *   [c, e, d]
 *   [c, d]
 *   [e, d]
 *   [e]
 * ```
 * ... etc.
 *
 * If no resolver is provided, a default one will be used. The default resolver simply concatenates
 * the concurrent branches in an arbitrary but deterministic order.
 *
 * You can also get the sequence of a fragment of a chain, by passing a `root` and/or a `head`; this
 * will resolve the subchain starting at `root` and ending at `head`.
